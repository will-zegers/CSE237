Just realized a little bit ago my frequency units are off by a factor of 1000 (using GHz instead of MHz). Chalk it up to working with picoseconds (instead of ns) in another class and not paying careful enough attention to large numbers. I don't mind if it ends up in a point deduction, I was careless afterall, but just wanted to clarify that I don't usually come off this clueless in dealing with clock frequencies.
